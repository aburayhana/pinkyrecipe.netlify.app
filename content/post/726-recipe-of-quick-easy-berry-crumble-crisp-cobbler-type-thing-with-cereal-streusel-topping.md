recipeingredient:
- " For streusel topping"
- "1 cup cereal with flakes if its got dried fruits and nuts even better Granola and muesli work too"
- "1 stick (8 Tablespoons) butter cut into 12 cubes"
- "3/4 cups packed brown sugar light or dark ok"
- "1/2 cup AP flour"
- "1/8-1/2 teaspoon kosher salt depending on how much you like that sweetsalty contrast in your desserts"
- "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
- " Berry filling"
- "1.5-2 lbs berries washed and drained Most kinds can be left whole strawberries should be halved quartered depending on size"
- "1.5-2 Tablespoons flour or corn starch"
- "1-3 Tablespoons sugar depending on how tart your berries are and how sweet you want your filling"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "1 Tablespoon water for each 12 pound of berries"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, throw in all the streusel topping ingredients, making sure to distribute the salt and cinnamon as evenly as you can across the mixture. Leaving the cereal off to one side, use your fingers in a milking motion to incorporate the butter, brown sugar and flour together until you have pea-sized clumps."
- "Add the cereal in and gently massage to evenly incorporate it throughout the butter/sugar/flour paste. Put in a container and refrigerate for at least 20 to 25 minutes to allow the butter to harden again before baking. If you&#39;re going to bake fairly immediately, put the streusel mixture in the freezer for a good 10 to 15 minutes before baking."
- "Preheat the oven to 400F (This usually takes anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the oven)."
- "Prepare the berries by gently tossing them in a large bowl with the flour or corn starch and sugar to evenly distribute the flour and sugar and to coat each berry thoroughly."
- "Pour the berry mixture into a baking dish that is at least large enough in surface area to allow you to spread the berries in a roughly 2-inch layer. Then spoon the appropriate amount of water over the top of the fruit mixture. The reason I suggest the water be added after the fruit is mixed with the flour or starch and sugar is to avoid too much clumping."
- "Top the berries with a roughly 2/3-inch layer of streusel topping and bake for roughly 25 minutes, or until the streusel topping is baked through to a dark golden brown. Not to worry if your baking dish is so large that the berries would spread out more thinly. Just gather them toward the center to make a roughly 2-inch thick mound. It&#39;s called a crumble. How precise could it be, right? :D"
- "Cool for 10 minutes or so and serve a heaping scoopful with a slightly less heaping scoopful of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream on top. Enjoy! :)"
- "P.S. Leftovers go great with your morning yogurt. ;)"

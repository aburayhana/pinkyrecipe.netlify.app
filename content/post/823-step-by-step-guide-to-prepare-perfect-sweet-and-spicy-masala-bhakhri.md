recipeingredient:
- "3/4 cup regular wheat flour"
- "1 tsp ghee"
- "1 tbsp jaggery"
- "As needed Ghee for topping"
- "As needed Methi masala achar pickle masalafor topping"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine flour, ghee and jaggery really well. There should be no grains or lumps of jaggery remaining in flour. Slice jaggery with a knife or pound it in a mortar and then add in case it&#39;s hard. Make stiff dough by adding just a little water. Knead well."
- "Pinch out a small portion, make a smooth ball by rolling in between your palms and flatten it to roll. Roll it evenly, keeping it a bit thick. You may need to apply a bit ghee/oil on the rolling board if it&#39;s sticky while rolling. Gently lift and place it on a moderately hot tava. Keep the heat to the minimum."
- "Flip it gently after a while when it&#39;s still semi cooked on that side. Cook for a little while again till it&#39;s semi cooked on the other side. Now flip it back and start pressing it with a wooden tool or with a cloth till it&#39;s nice and golden. Repeat the procedure for the other side too."
- "Take it off the tava when it&#39;s equally brown on both the sides and it&#39;s nice and crunchy. Apply a lot of ghee while making cuts through the Bhakhri. Sprinkle achar masala on the top. Prepare all Bhakhris similarly. Enjoy hot or cold- both has it&#39;s own unique flavour."

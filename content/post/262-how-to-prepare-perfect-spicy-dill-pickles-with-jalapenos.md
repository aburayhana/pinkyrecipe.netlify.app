recipeingredient:
- "10 Kirby Cucumbers"
- "5 medium Jalapeno peppers"
- "1 large red bell pepper"
- "1/2 medium red onion"
- "4 cup apple cider vinegar"
- "4 cup filtered water"
- "4 1/2 tbsp pickling salt"
- "12 clove garlic smashed and peeled"
- "8 tsp dill seeds"
- "4 tsp black peppercorns"
- "2 tsp red chile flakes"
- "4 quart canning jars with fresh lids"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash jars thoroughly in warm, soapy water. If you plan on making shelf stable pickles, prepare a boiling water bath canner. Put fresh canning jar lids into a small saucepan with 3 inches of water and set to the barest simmer."
- "Wash and dry kirby cucumbers. Remove blossom end. Cut into 1/4&#34; thick slices."
- "Wash and dry Jalapeno peppers. Remove stems. Cut into 1/4&#34; thick slices and remove seeds."
- "Wash and dry red bell pepper. Remove stem. Cut into 1/4&#34; thick slices and remove seeds."
- "Cut red onion into 1/4&#34; thick slices."
- "Combine vinegar, water and salt in sauce pan and bring to a boil."
- "Place all the veggies in a large bowl and toss until they are mixed together well."
- "Equally divide the veggies between the jars."
- "Equally divide garlic cloves, dill seed, black peppercorns and red chili flakes between the jars."
- "Pour the brine into the jars, leaving at least 1/4 inch headspace (that&#39;s the amount of space between the surface of the brine and the rim of the jar)."
- "Remove any air bubbles from jars by gently tapping them. I use the handle of a wooden spoon to make sure the brine is well integrated and all the bubbles are out."
- "Wipe rims and apply lids and bands (don&#39;t screw them on too tightly)."
- "If processing jars for shelf stability, lower jars into your processing pot. When water returns to a boil, set a timer for 10 minutes. When time is up, remove jars from canning pot and allow them to cool. When jars are cool enough to handle, check seals."
- "If your&#39;re not processing the jars for shelf stability, let them cool before putting them into the refrigerator. Do note that your jars may seal during the cooling process. However, without the boiling water bath process, that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re shelf stable. They still must be refrigerated."
- "Let pickles rest for at least one week before eating."

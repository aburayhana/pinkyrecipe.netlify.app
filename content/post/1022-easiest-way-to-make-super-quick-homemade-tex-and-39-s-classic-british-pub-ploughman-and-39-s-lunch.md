recipeinstructions:
- "Because of it&#39;s simplicity of ingredients, the keyword to any Ploughman&#39;s is &#39;generosity&#39;. Ask yourself if your Ploughman&#39;s is going to be filling enough to keep a hardworking ploughman going for a whole afternoon?"
- "This should do it, right?"
- "Before you do anything else, pop your beer in the freezer for about 20 minutes to get it good and frosty ❄ Next, cut a good sized wedge from your cheese"
- "Add your crusty cob to the plate, unsliced, with the butter. Tiger rolls are also a good alternative, as are sliced baguettes or petit pain"
- "Plate up your pickles and/or chutneys. Use toothpicks to make your pickled onions easier to eat. I&#39;m using traditional pickled silverskin onions, and Branston&#39;s (ploughman&#39;s) pickle. Suggestions for other sides are listed in the introduction at the top of the page."
- "Add the cheese, ham, and salad..."
- "Slice a wedge from the pork pie if using, and add to the plate. Strictly speaking, pork pie is not an original component, but it has become a somewhat traditional addition to a Ploughman&#39;s, and they taste awesome with cheese and pickle.

- "Serve with a fork 🍴 and a cheese knife or a table knife 🔪 capable of cutting the bread, the cheese, and spreading the butter. Apparently the table etiquette with cobs and bread buns is that you should tear them if you&#39;re not going to butter them, but slice them if you are. I don&#39;t think ploughmen would&#39;ve paid much attention to etiquette though..."
- "...and of course, don&#39;t forget your pint of ale, straight from the freezer. 🍻"
- "If you want to add a few herbs as a garnish etc., the following all go well with cheese: ~ parsley ~ thyme ~ tarragon ~ marjoram ~ basil And of course dill goes great with pickles, and sage is lovely with onions"
- "I&#39;m just dressing with Heinz salad cream..."

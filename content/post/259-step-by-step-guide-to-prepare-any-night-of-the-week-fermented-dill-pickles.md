- "6 tbsp salt"
- "1 tbsp whole pepper corns black"
- "2 clove garlic cloves crushed"

recipeinstructions:
- "Take the jar fill with cucumbers.  Add dill weed and seed. Add crushed garlic."
- "Take the water hot from the tap add salt and desolve the salt. Pour it over the contents of the jar."
- "Take the zip lock bag add water cover over the opening of jar. This will allow gases to escape safely.  Put in a cool dry place."
- "Let sit 6 - 7 days when bubbles have quit rising.  Check it a couple of times a day to skim the scum off top if any gets on bag rinse it off."
- "Once this happens, cover the jar loosely and place in the refrigerator for 3 days, skimming daily or as needed. Store for up to 2 months in the refrigerator, skimming as needed. If the pickles should become soft or begin to take on an off odor, this is a sign of spoilage and they should be throwed out."
